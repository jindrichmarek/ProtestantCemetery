            <decoDesc><summary>Stone statue of young man dressed in eighteenth (?) century fashion, resting on a sofa, he is turned towards west. His head rests on his right hand. He has a small Pekinese dog lying beside him and his left hand holding a book is resting upon the dog. There is a thin blanket thrown over the middle part of his body. Behind his back there is a sword and scabbard. On the top of the chest there is a statue of a reclining male figure, presumably the deceased. He is propped up on his right elbow, and he has a half/open book in his left hand. There is a small dog ---a King Charles Spaniel---lying against his torso. Lying behind him is a large cavalry sword. The figure is lying on, and has half/draped over him, his topcoat.</summary>
